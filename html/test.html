	<h1>Thoughts on sadness and sickness</h1>
	<h2 id="what">What is sadness?</h2>
	<p>It can literally be anything. Your favourite anime is over. Sadness. Your character dies. Sadness. You break up. Sadness. You text someone but they sleep. Sadness. You text them so you skip your sleep and feel tired. Sadness. Everything is sadness.</p>
	<blockquote>I just want to be happy, right?</blockquote>
	<p>I thought I was selfish for asking too much from the above. Maybe they are mad for I'm not making enough effort and instead, asking for their help. Why, I never wish to rely on them. I want to break free from this chain of karma. <b>We are all grounded.</b></p>
	<p>Some days, I waking up wanting to die. Some days, usually after talking to people, I might feel like wanting to live. At times, I want to connect. At times, I want to isolate myself.</p>
	<em>I just realise I am so sad.</em>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<h2 id="why">Why sadness?</h2>
	<p>Sometimes, most of the time, sadness has a reason. You lose your job. You can't find a job. You got a job and got fired. It just makes sense.</p>
	<p>Though, sometimes, I am sad for no reason. I had so much fun talking to this friend, they boom, sadness hit. I succumbed to my sadness. Dopamine reached its peak. I couldn't absord any more fun. Then things went downhill like a rollercoaster reaching its peak now travelling down at an insane speed. But instead of the excitement you feel when driving a rollercoaster down, you feel the plunge to hell - <strong>The hell of sadness.</strong></p>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<h2 id="how">How to deal with sadness</h2>
	<p>You fuck around with it and/or it fucks you. There is no in between.</p>
	<p>You can ignore it, but as soon as you have nothing to bother with, it comes back to you with a demonic smile:</p>
	<blockquote>"Miss me?"</blockquote>
	<p>You are your very enemy.</p>
